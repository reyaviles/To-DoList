Hello!

This application is a template design for a to-do list. 
You can create new items for your to-do list by typing a to-do item in the text-field and then hitting the '+' button.
You can delete an item by clicking the check-box

If you need to make multiple to-do lists, I got you covered!
Just type any url-slug '/example' and you will be redirected to a new to-do list with the url-slug in the Header.
Worried about typos or weird casing ('/exAmplE')? The URL slug is always reformatted to proper heading capitalization.

Lastly, this was designed as a project for a Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu.
Shoutout to her and the course!
